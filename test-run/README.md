#### This folder contains partial results for test run for this project
The folder is organized in this way:  
The folders of format **50_1** stay for query 50_1. Each of above folder has 5 sub-folder of format **docs_20**, where the name stays for the number of documents that were 
retrieved. Inside the latest, there are 5 files:
- *labels.csv* - contains labels generated by best _LDA_ model with **k-topics** based on coherence score 
- _output_candidates_ - candidate labels for **k-topics** given labels from _LDA_
- _output_supervised_ - produces top 3 labels for each topic using supervised approach given candidate labels
- _output_unsupervised_ - produces top 3 labels for each topic using unsupervised approach given candidate labels
- _score.png_ - a plot for visualization of various *LDA* models with different number of topics  

#### Improvements
It is possible to observe that retrieving a large number of document, the optimal value of topics is high. In this test,
I assumed that every topic has the same importance, but it real world it can be not the case. I do not know if it worth
to discuss the option of reducing the number of topics and choosing the best **n** topics.
